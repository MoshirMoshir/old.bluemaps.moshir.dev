# BlueMaps
BlueMaps is an interactive map of the Blue Hole from Dave the Diver! <br>
Navigate your way from the Shallows to the Depths and also find points of interests with ease!

## !!! Announcement 31 March 2025 !!!
I finally have the skillset to develop this into a webapp of what I intended it to be. <br>
### The new map will be live May 1st 2025! (same link at bluemaps.moshir.dev)
> The old site will still be accessable, and moved to old.bluemaps.moshir.dev

<br>

The Site is still in development but planned features are:

 - [x] High quality 2d unrendered versions of every map obtained and uploaded
 - [x] Usablity on mobile
 - [x] Created groundwork code for overlays
 - [x] Add groundwork/code of overlays
 - [x] Update Maps to be less cluttered
 - [ ] Add Shark Overlay
 - [x] Add Escape Pod Overlay
 - [ ] Add Fish Overlay
 - [ ] Add Items Overlay
 - [ ] Add additional pages exclusive to each depth
 - [ ] Make the Main Map page prettier and overhaul Website UI
 - [ ] Add pages where you can find more information about fish, mission locations, etc (mini-wiki)
 - [ ] Stitching together or obtaining high quality rendered versions of every map (This is extremely tedious and will probably not happen unless someone else does it)
 - [ ] More features TBD

> This project was inspired by KlinkerKlank's original efforts in making a map which can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2921898835)
> I have since removed easy access of his map from the site as I am working on the features that will outclass his original map, but you can still find it [here](https://bluemaps.moshir.dev/klinkerklank.html)
